# Usage

The main purpose for this program is to read scene files, raycast plane and sphere primitives, and write to image data output. 

Command Line: ``` raycast width height input.scene output.ppm ``` 


# Known Issues
	 Program doesn't work, we couldn't figure out how to properly raycast in time. All it does is it reads the entire scene file and stores it in the appropriate structures.
